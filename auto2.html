                <p>I introduce My self, I am Carl Justin Clamor born in Kawit Cavite in September 17 2004, Now currently I am 20 Years old, In 20 years of existence I've gain a lot of knowledge especially about Life, Because I've done a lot of mistakes so I take advantage of it, I apply it to My Self to become a man not kid or a little boy.</p>
                <br>
                <p>Ok fast forward, When I graduated grade 6 in Kawit,Cavite and finally excited I become a Junior High School (Grade 7) I thought I was cool, I mean I thought its happy but its not, I've become worse kid that time, I do smoke because of influence of friends and I always do cutting classes to play a computer game, And worse because I always demand for my daily allowance cost of 100 pesos per day, And I stop that year because I always get in trouble because of my friends that I thougt I was cool and right.</p>
                <br>
                <p>So after my Grade 7 in Kawit,Cavite I got transfer here in Gentri,Cavite and that time I met my friends now A bestfriends that very truly to me, And the first day I got cutt classes nothing changes, But when I saw my adviser to call the Mother of my classmates that got cutt classes I realized I dont want to get In trouble again, I am the kind of person very weak in class or Im not good at class because I always nervous in the front of the classroom, And that time I maybe the worse as always I got influence again, I thought It was another friend but not I smoke weeds worse than ever and I now I felt regret.</p>
                <br>
                <p>After grade 8 the pandemic days, Now I missed those days like playing games,watching Tv and fast forward, When I was grade 11 I met a lot of friends, On the first day of creating a Gc's I am the center of my classmates I mean the center of friends like that, Because I create a lot of Gc's, I am very happy that time because I thought I was stuck in the past like always got influence but not that time, And that year I met my Live in Partner right now, A long story but I did not regret about what happen, We are the same grade level that time but not the same section a confidential so Im not tell what happen, And lastly we become Grade 12, That time a lot of 'Bullies' even my old friend in G11 are very umh like(Plastik), That time I am full of anger like I want to get revenge like in my mind I alwayds killing, That time I want to get revenge but I realize when I do that we are not able to Graduate Senior High School, Someday maybe the karma you know.</p>
                <br>
                <p>Before end I tell my Hobby, My Hobby are gaining knowledge about Web Hacking, Now I hack 2 Govenrments Website I Hack thru Sql Injection attack and I properly reported the vulnerabilities I found but no response.</p>
